                    A capsule wardrobe is a small collection of quality clothing items that can be styled and worn in
                    many different ways. Capsule wardrobes make getting dressed easier and less stressful by focusing on
                    pieces that work well together. Creating a capsule closet helps save money and encourages people to
                    wear items they already own instead of buying cheap clothing to only wear once.
